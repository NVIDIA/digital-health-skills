## Description: <br>
Use when the user wants to deploy, run, or test a TTS (speech-synthesis) Riva NIM — cloud-hosted (build.nvidia.com) or self-hosted Magpie / voice cloning. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers deploying, testing, or running NVIDIA Riva TTS NIMs for text-to-speech synthesis workflows, either cloud-hosted via build.nvidia.com or self-hosted with Docker/Kubernetes. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Shell commands, Configuration instructions] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline bash code blocks] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [None] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`claude-code`) <br>
- Codex (`codex`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 1 evaluation task with 2 attempts per task; pass threshold 50%. Evaluation profile: external. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 2 | 100% (+0%) | 100% (+50%) |
| Correctness | 2 | 100% (+0%) | 92% (+2%) |
| Discoverability | 2 | 94% (+4%) | 80% (+4%) |
| Effectiveness | 2 | 89% (+1%) | 88% (+23%) |
| Efficiency | 2 | 83% (+11%) | 78% (+10%) |
