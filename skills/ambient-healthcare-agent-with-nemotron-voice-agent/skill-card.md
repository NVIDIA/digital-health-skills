## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
3 evaluation tasks (2 positive, 1 negative), each run 3 times in isolated sandbox pods. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill avoids unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Tool-call productivity (50%) and token efficiency (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 90.3% | 85.2% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 pts) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 pts) |
| Correctness | 32.0% → 93.3% (+61.3 pts) | 32.0% → 93.3% (+61.3 pts) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% | 47.5% |
| Effectiveness | 58.3% → 72.8% (+14.5 pts) | 43.3% → 87.8% (+44.5 pts) |
| Efficiency | 85.2% | 97.2% |
